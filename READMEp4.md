Project Description:
This is the frontend repo for a gamesite app. Basically, it would be like one of those free game sites where you can play games on your computer. The difference is that you would have to log in and actually save the links to the games you want to play. One could also make their own games (or their own versions) and save them on here to show to prospective employers, an additional project showcase if you will.
